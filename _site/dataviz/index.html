    <p>Welcome to the first post about in this data visualization blog.</p>

<p>Here we will give take a first look at what dataviz is, and why it is important.</p>

<h2 id="data-visualization-in-the-scientific-process">Data visualization in the scientific process</h2>
<p>Data visualization plays a major role in most phases of the scientific processes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At the beginning of the analysis, when one wants to understand the structure of the data and find recurrent patterns (exploratory).</li>
  <li>During the model building, when one wants to compare the model with the data (confirmatory).</li>
  <li>When presenting the results to the audience (explanatory).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we will mostly talk about the last case, namely <strong>explanatory</strong> data visualization.</p>

<p>Let us first clarify that, although you will be tempted to use the figures from the first phases in the last phase, you shouldn’t
do that.
In the first phases what you are trying to do is to understand something by scraping the data and looking at the data from different
perspectives.
On the other hand, the aim of the last phase is to summarize what you found by using data visualization.
Since you have two different objectives, you should consider using different tools and languages to do that, and the (graphical)
language you should use in the last phase strongly depends on your audience.</p>

<p>When trying to understand the structure of your data, any quantitative assessment will be helpful, while you won’t likely
put annotations on your plots.
If you want your audience to easily catch some particular message from your data, annotations may be helpful,
and maybe the audience you are presenting your data to is not able to give a broader context to the numerical values of the data,
so adding the ticks may be superfluous.</p>

<p>Moving the axis away from zero in the exploratory phase is common if one wants to clearly spot any kind of pattern in the data,
but doing so in the explanatory context might be dangerous, as this could be seen as an attempt to trick your audience.</p>

<p>In this blog, when talking about data visualization, unless otherwise specified we will usually refer to explanatory data visualization.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-use-it">Why you should use it</h2>
<p>The raw form for most of the data is usually a tabular form,
where one has a set of attributes for a given number of items.
However we can only keep in mind a limited number of values, and typically this
number is of the order of 10, unless you don’t rely on special techniques.</p>

<div class="emphbox">
While the tabular format is good to inspect each item's properties,
it is hard to understand if there is
any pattern into the data, especially if the number of items grows.
</div>

<p>One could think and rely on statistical, ML or other fancier models, but they may be misused, and 
a model may give results which may look reasonable but are actually wrong.
I love statistical models, but one should always ensure that the model makes sense for the dataset,
in Bayesian statistics this is usually done by using posterior predictive checks.</p>

<p>Even in a one dimensional model you may be tempted to use the mean to summarize the typical value of the data,
but this wouldn’t makes sense at all for a multimodal distribution, and the easiest way to spot multimodality
is to simply plot the data.</p>

<p><img src="/docs/assets/images/visualization/anscombe.png" alt="The Anscombe quartet" /></p>

<p>The one shown before is the celeb Anscombe quartet.
It is a dataset composed by four different subsets of data,
and it has been constructed to show that the same statistical model may give identical
results for many different data.
As you can see, the four fits are identical, but the underlying data are very different.</p>

<div class="emphbox">
Always use data visualization to make sure that the model is appropriate for your data.
</div>

<h2 id="what-do-you-risk-by-misinterpreting-the-data">What do you risk by misinterpreting the data</h2>
<p><img src="/docs/assets/images/visualization/cat.png" alt="An image from a Computerized Axial Tomography" /></p>

<p>Data visualization became a part of everyday life, but by using it
in the wrong way one may encounter many risk.
The above image is taken from the Wikipedia page of the CT scan,
and it uses a very common color palette, the well known rainbow color map.
Unfortunately, in the dataviz community, it is well known that this is
one of the worst color map you could use when you want your
audience to be able and quickly quantify the numerical value
associated with the color.</p>

<p>If your audience is not able to assess the numerical variation associated
to a color variation, they may take wrong decisions such as giving the wrong
therapy or making the wrong investment as they cannot properly
quantify the risk.</p>

<p>This is simply an example, but the more data visualization enters in our
life, the more are the risks associated to a miscommunication problems
due to improper visualizations.</p>

<div class="emphbox">
Data visualization is about assessing the quality of a visualization
from a scientific point of view, and it relies on what is known about
how our brain perceives images.
</div>

<p>In the following we will give an overview about this topic, but the reader
should keep in mind that this is not a blog about neuroscience, so we will
limit our discussion to what is necessary in order to achieve our
goal.</p>

<!--

Before doing so it's better to put here some vocabulary.

A data visualization is first of all made by **markers**, namely the graphical
objects that we use to represent our items.
The most common markers are:
- points
- lines
- bars
- areas

For each item we will represent some quantity, and we will do so by using one or more
**visual channels** like:
- position
- size (length/width/area)
- angle/slope
- color hue
- color intensity
- shape and textures

Other fundamental components of the visualization are the components which allow
us to contextualize and interpret the visualization.
Those components can be geometric components like axes, grids, reference lines
but also textual components such as labels and annotations.

A visual representation is a combination of such components, and you will find a huge variety visual representations,
as there is a potentially infinite number of ways to combine these ingredients.
So how to choose one? Which is the best?

As often happens, there is not **the best** representation, as we already said elsewhere in this blog, there is no silver bullet.
A better question is

> What is the most appropriate way to visualize this aspect of the data?

This of course depends on many factors, and you will often find yourself in a situation where you simply
have to decide how to balance your needs.
Data visualization is the discipline which wants to address to this question from a scientific perspective.

I will try and share some resources about this topic in some future post, as well as to share some hopefully interesting personal thoughts.
