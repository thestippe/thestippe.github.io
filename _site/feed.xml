Bayesian statistics allows to build custom and structured models by simply specifying the data generating process.
The model can be divided into two parts:</p>

<p>The likelihood 
$P(y \vert \theta)$, which determines how the data we want to model are generated.</p>

<p>The priors $P(\theta)$, which specifies our hypothesis about the value of the parameters of the model.</p>
