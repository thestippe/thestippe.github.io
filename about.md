I am a theoretical physicist, and I currently work as a data scientist. I worked in a variety of fields, as credit risk assessment, portfolio allocation and healthcare.
During my career I found that Bayesian statistics can be a very useful tool, but all the lectures about Bayesian statistics I could find used R as programming language [^1].


[^1]: It is almost impossible to build any non-trivial model without using a programming language.
