I am Stefano, and I am currently working as data scientist.
I worked as data scientist in a variety of fields, as credit risk assessment, portfolio allocation and healthcare.
I studied as a physicist, and during my research studies I always applied numerical methods to nuclear physics [^2].
Soon I met Monte Carlo methods, as Gibbs sampling is one of the main tool to study the atomic nuclei in Lattice Quantum Field Theory.
In my spare time I try and give some contribution to the Italian Skeptic Community, named [CICAP](https://cicap.org), and whenever I can I travel.

During my career as data scientist, I found that Bayesian statistics can be a very useful tool, but all the lectures about Bayesian statistics
I could find were using R as programming language, as this is the most common programming language among statisticians [^1].
However I always used Python, as R is rarely used in nuclear physics, so I decided to build my own notes in Python,
combining what I learned from PyMC tutorials, statistics textbooks, online courses and from my own experience.
The main resources I used are listed in the [resources](/links) section.

My interests about statistics also include data visualization, causal inference and any other (not necessarily Bayesian) method which may help 
solid and replicable findings as well ass improving results communication.

I would like to thank anyone who shared his/her knowledge in this beautiful field, first of all the PyMC team. 
On the other hand, any error in these notes is my own responsibility, and if you find any please let my know by writing an email.
Finally, I would like to point out that views are my own, and opinions expressed here are not necessarily shared by the authors
of the cited articles.

[^1]: It is almost impossible to build any non-trivial model without using a programming language.
[^2]: I started with C and C++ but I soon switched to Python, which is way more friendly, and I soon get passionate about it and by Linux in general.
