I am a theoretical physicist, and I currently work as a data scientist. I worked in a variety of fields, as credit risk assessment, portfolio allocation and healthcare.
During my career I found that Bayesian statistics can be a very useful tool, but all the lectures about Bayesian statistics I could find were using R as programming language [^1].
However I always used python (R is rarely used in physics), so I decided to build my own notes in python, combining PyMC tutorials with statistics textbooks and online courses.
The resources I used are listed in the [resources](/links) section, and I would like to thank anyone who shared his/her knowledge in this beautiful field by starting from the PyMC
team. On the other hand, any error in these notes is my own responsibility, and if you find any please let my know by writing an email.
