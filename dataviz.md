<div class="emphbox">
Here you will find some thoughts about
data visualization, from basic principles
to real-world applications.
</div>

<span style="font-family:Zapfino;font-size:280%;line-height:36%">I</span> plot data since quite many years, but only few months ago I really went into
data visualization (aka dataviz).

I attended Enrico Bertini's Coursera specialization, which explains how to design and evaluate data visualizations,
and it does so by starting from what is currently known about our brain's processes in visual perception.

Since I discovered this research field I started reading books talking about it,
and I began with the ones written by the data visualization pioneer [Edward Tufte](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte).
You will find out more resources in the [dedicated section](/links) of this blog.

When I started I used Python, and during the years I tried different technologies for this purpose, from Tableau to d3js.

I would like to share some (hopefully intelligent) though about data visualization.
Moreover, as Tufte himself wrote in his book Beautiful Evidence, "as teachers know, a very good way to learn something is to teach it", so let's try.

I hope you will enjoy!
