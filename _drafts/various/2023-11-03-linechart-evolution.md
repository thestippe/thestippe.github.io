In a previous post we saw some of the most fundamental charts,
which are the basic building blocks for data visualization.

Datasets can become very complex, and you should adapt your data visualization
depending on your needs.
Here we will take a look at how we can draw more and more complex datasets
by simply changing few details of the basic visualization, and we will
do so by using the line chart as fundamental visualization.

## The line chart

As we have already seen, in the line chart we have
- an ordered variable on the $x$ axis
- a quantitative variable on the $y$ axis
