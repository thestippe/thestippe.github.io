In the [last](/predictive_checks/) post we looked at how one can assess a model's ability to reproduce the data.
In this post we will look at a related topic, which is how we can compare two or more Bayesian models.
In fact, you rarely know from the beginning what is the most appropriate model to fit your data.
Most of the times you will find yourself building different models for the same dataset,
and a crucial part of your work will be to compare them.
Comparing model sometimes may be understood as choosing the best model,
but in most cases it means to asses which model is better to describe or predict some particular aspect of your data.
Model comparison can be done analytically in some case,
but most of the time it will be done numerically or graphically, and here we will give an overview of the most important tools.
