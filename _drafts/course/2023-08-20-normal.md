Up to this moment our task was to model some random discrete variables. 
In this post we will look at some continuous model, and the most common one
is by far the Normal model.
Let us try and see its main features by looking at some physical data.

## Neutrinos and the Normal model
I downloaded the zip file from [this page](https://icecube.wisc.edu/data-releases/2018/07/icecube-data-from-2008-to-2017-related-to-analysis-of-txs-0506056/)
of the [IceCube](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube) experiment website.
In the zip you will find many files, let us look at the one named "events_IC86b.txt"

```python
df = pd.read_csv('./events_IC86b.txt', sep=',')
df.head()
```

This dataset collects the characteristics of some muon (a kind of elementary particle)
observed from the IceCube experiment in the South Pole.
For the moment we are only interested in the last column, which represents
the logarithm of the reconstructed muon energy.

We only observe positive values, but the logarithm of a positive quantity is a real quantity, which can take any value.
Moreover the data looks roughly symmetric, so we can try and use a Normal model:

```python
with pm.Model() as normal_model:
    mu = pm.Normal('mu', mu=0, sigma=10)
    sigma = pm.Gamma('sigma', mu=1, sigma=1)
    y = pm.Normal('y', mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=df['log10(Ereco)'])
    trace_normal = pm.sample()
az.plot_trace(trace_normal)
```


![Normal model trace](/docs/assets/images/normal/trace_neutrinos_normal.jpg)

The trace looks fine, let us check if our model correctly reproduces the data:

```python
with normal_model:
   ppc_normal = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace_normal)
az.plot_ppc(ppc_normal)
```

![Normal model ppc](/docs/assets/images/normal/ppc_neutrinos_normal.jpg)

Our model is clearly unable to reproduce the data.
Our dataset contains some events which are located far away from $1\sigma$.
On the other hand, the normal pdf drops to zero already for $3\sigma\,.$
We should look for a more general model, which allows for a slower decrease of the pdf or,
in the statistical jargon we should look for a distribution with heavier tails than the normal one.
We can try a Student-t model, which is a generalization of the Normal distribution.
This distribution has an additional parameter $\nu\,,$ which allows to tune the heaviness of the tails 
and such that, in the limit $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, it corresponds to the Normal distribution.

```python
with pm.Model() as t_model:
    mu = pm.Normal('mu', mu=0, sigma=10)
    sigma = pm.Gamma('sigma', mu=1, sigma=1)
    nu = pm.Exponential('nu', lam=1)
    y = pm.StudentT('y', mu=mu, sigma=sigma, nu=nu, observed=df['log10(Ereco)'])
    trace_t = pm.sample()
az.plot_trace(trace_t)
```

![Student-t model trace](/docs/assets/images/normal/trace_neutrinos_t.jpg)

In our case we have $\nu \approx 3\,,$ which suggests that the Normal distribution
is not well suited to fit the data.
Let us now check if this model improves the fit:

```python
with t_model:
   ppc_t = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace_t)
az.plot_ppc(ppc_t)
```

![Student-t model ppc](/docs/assets/images/normal/ppc_neutrinos_t.jpg)

Now the black line is always inside the blue region, so the fit highly improved.
