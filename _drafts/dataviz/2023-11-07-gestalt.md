Gestalt principles are largely used in design
in order to convey grouping among items in 
a visualization.
Here we will discuss them in order to understand
how to leverage them in dataviz.

## Proximity

The proximity principle states that nearby objects are perceived as a group.


<script src="/docs/assets/javascript/gestalt/proximity.js">
</script>

<div id="proximity">
</div>

By looking at the above figure,
in the first case you will probably see
a grid,
in the second one a collection
of columns and in the third one a 
collection of rows.

## Similarity

## Connection

## Closure

## Enclosure

## Continuity
