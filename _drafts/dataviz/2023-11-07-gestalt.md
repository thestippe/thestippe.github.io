Gestalt principles are widely used in design in order to convey grouping among items in 
a visualization.
Here we will discuss them in order to understand how to leverage them in dataviz.

I found many versions of the Gestalt principles online, and I collected
and reorganized all of them as best as I could.

## Proximity

<div class='emphbox'>
Nearby objects are perceived as a group.
</div>


<script src="/docs/assets/javascript/gestalt/proximity.js">
</script>

<div id="proximity">
</div>

By looking at the above figure,
in the first case you will probably see
a grid,
in the second one a collection
of columns and in the third one a 
collection of rows.

## Similarity
<div class='emphbox'>
Similar objects are perceived as a group.
</div>

<script src="/docs/assets/javascript/gestalt/similarity.js">
</script>

<div id="similarity">
</div>

In this case, even if our objects are equally spaced, we naturally perceive
two groups of objects, and each group has a different color.

## Connection

<div class='emphbox'>
Objects which look connected are perceived as a group.
</div>

<svg height=400 width=400>
<rect x=100 y=100 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 
<rect x=100 y=300 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 
<rect x=300 y=100 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 
<rect x=300 y=300 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 

<line x1="200" y1="150" x2="300" y2="150" stroke="gray" style="stroke-width:3;" />
<line x1="200" y1="350" x2="300" y2="350" stroke="gray" style="stroke-width:3;" />
</svg>

In the above figure, according to the Gestalt principles, you should
perceive the two squares in the first line as connected, as well
as the two squares in the second line.
This principle is used in many charts, like the parallel coordinates plot.

## Enclosure

<div class='emphbox'>
Objects which are enclosed within a perimeter are perceived as a group.
</div>

<svg height=500 width=500>
<rect x=100 y=100 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 
<rect x=100 y=300 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 
<rect x=300 y=100 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 
<rect x=300 y=300 width=100 height=100 style="fill:steelblue"/> 

<line x1="50" y1="50" x2="450" y2="50" stroke="gray" style="stroke-width:3;" />
<line x1="450" y1="50" x2="450" y2="250" stroke="gray" style="stroke-width:3;" />
<line x1="450" y1="250" x2="50" y2="250" stroke="gray" style="stroke-width:3;" />
<line x1="50" y1="250" x2="50" y2="50" stroke="gray" style="stroke-width:3;" />
</svg>

In this example, the objects enclosed within the gray lines are perceived
as grouped together.

## Closure and continuity

<div class='emphbox'>
We see complete figures even if part of the
information is missing.
</div>

<svg id="triangle" height=400 width=400>
<circle cx=150 cy=165 r=40 style="fill:steelblue"/>
<circle cx=200 cy=250 r=40 style="fill:steelblue"/>
<circle cx=100 cy=250 r=40 style="fill:steelblue"/>
<polygon points="150 165, 200 250, 100 250" style="fill:#fffcfa"/>
</svg>

In the above figure we see a triangle, even if
there are pieces of its perimeter which
are missing.

The same principle also applies to lines,
but in this case it is often called continuity
principle.


<div id="continuity">
</div>

<script src="/docs/assets/javascript/gestalt/continuity.js">
</script>

In this figure this principle is applied twice: we both perceive many small circles even if the lines are dashed,
and we perceive one big circle even if there is no circle drawn.

## Figure-ground

<div class='emphbox'>
When we look at objects in one image, we wither instinctively identify them
as foreground or as background.
</div>

![](/docs/assets/images/gestalt/Cup_or_faces_paradox.svg)

<br>

The Rubin vase is a common example of this principle,
where one either identifies two faces or a vase, and switching between
one idea and the other is rather difficult.

This fact is related to the following principle

## Multistability

<div class='emphbox'>
When an image has more than one interpretation, we cannot
see more than one simultaneously.
</div>

Switching between different interpretations is called multistability.


## Invariance

<div class='emphbox'>
We are able to recognize objects even if they are deformed or rotated.
</div>

![](/docs/assets/images/gestalt/captcha.svg)

This principle is the one leveraged by captchas.

## Continuation

<div class='emphbox'>
When two or more objects are intersecting we perceive each of them 
as uninterrupted.
</div>

<svg height=300 width=400>
<g transform="rotate(45 110 200)">
<rect x=100 y=100 height=200 width=20 style="fill:crimson"/>
</g>

<g transform="rotate(-45 110 200)">
<rect x=100 y=100 height=200 width=20 style="fill:steelblue"/>
</g>
</svg>

<br>

We perceive the above objects as a blue bar and a red bar,
despite the fact that what we actually see are a blue bar and two
red bars.

## Symmetry

<div class='emphbox'>
When there is a lack of symmetry, our attention is attracted by it.
</div>


<svg height=400 width=700>
<rect x=100 y=100 width=80 height=80 style="fill:crimson"/> 
<rect x=200 y=100 width=80 height=80 style="fill:crimson"/> 
<rect x=300 y=100 width=80 height=80 style="fill:crimson"/> 
<rect x=400 y=100 width=80 height=80 style="fill:crimson"/> 
<rect x=500 y=100 width=80 height=80 style="fill:green"/> 
</svg>

In the previous image, your eye will probably fall
on the green square, as it looks different from
the other squares.


## Common fate


<div class='emphbox'>
Objects that point to (or appear to be moving in) the same direction at the same
speed are perceived as a group.
</div>


<div id="fate">
</div>

<script src="/docs/assets/javascript/gestalt/fate.js">
</script>

In the above example, one can clearly distinguish a group
as the circles moving together around a same point.

Notice that we don't need them to actually move.
