Since I became a data scientist I heard many mantras
trying to sell the idea that data is the most valuable thing in the World,
since they objectively describe something.
Whoever tells you this, either is an ignorant, or a liar.
Data will rarely tell you *the* truth, as one can rarely define what truth is
in an objective way.
Data will tell you a story, and every story has a point of you.
You can try and be as most objective as possible, but you will hardly find a
way to be truly objective.

Data must be first of all be selected, and this is a matter of choice.
Whenever you find a dataset, ask yourself which is the origin of your data.
