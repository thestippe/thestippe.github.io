- Types of questions:
  - simple questions (yes/no)
  - running prompt (rarely/sometimes/ofter...)
  - single choice questions/multiple choice questions (mark all that applies)
  - filter question (es: ti e' mai capitato ...? SE SI, quando?)
  - open-ended questions
  - rating scales, unipolar scales vs bipolar scales, number of items (5-11). Midpoint? Labels? Numbers? Equidistant items!
        for numbers, 0/5 will have a different impact with respect to -2/2. Up/down vs left/right
  - using slider? bad idea

La comprensione deve essere la stessa per tutti (no ambiguita')

Coding abstract concepts into questions, finding the appropriate scale

Context effect
The issue of using images (bias introduction)
item-order effect (randomize answers when possible, first general questions then specific questions)

I don't know/ I don't want to answer

Long questionnaires might have higher non-response rate

A model of the answering process

facts vs quasi-facts (large subjective components e.g. race/ethnicity, gender) vs behaviors

recall problems (reference period, salience (individual) and under-reporting)
Reporting frequencies

sensitive questions

honestly explain how you will handle sensitive information

reducing non-response: briefly estimate the time it will take
