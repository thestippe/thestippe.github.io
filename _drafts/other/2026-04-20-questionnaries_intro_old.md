AI is often developed in order to assist, support or sometimes even replace
domain experts in specific tasks.
This implies that the data scientist has to compare AI-generated data
with human-generated data, and while the DS is supposed to
have a good understanding of AI-generated data, 
many of us 
are not prepared to handle human-generated data.

This is because analyzing human-generated data
generally requires a basic understanding of how humans think
and act. In other terms, if you want to properly deal with
this kind of data, you should have a good understanding of psychology.

The most common tool we use to collect data from people is by using
some kind of questionary, and questionnaires design is a 
broad multidisciplinary field, which involves psychologists,
UX experts, programmers, statisticians and other domain experts.

In the next section, I want to discuss some of the issues
you could face when dealing questionaries.
This does not want to be a course in psychology or UX design, but
it rather wants to be a warning about the fact that you could
need to consult someone with a deeper understanding of the topic,
otherwise you could end up doing a lot of useless work.

People change their mind, they sometimes feel 
uncomfortable when answering questions, they might lack
attention or forget stuff, and all these issues might undermine your data collection
process.

## A reasoning model

Before discussing how to write a question, we should think about
the answering process, and in order to do this we will start
from a very simple model describing the answering process:

1. reading
2. understanding
3. recalling
4. judgment
5. response

This already warns us about many of the possible issues in the
process: people might in fact misread or misunderstand the question,
they may forget things, and they might misreport events.

We must be sure that the respondent exactly understands
what we mean, so it's important to provide enough background
information so that there is no ambiguity about the desired
answer.

The first strategy to reduce unwanted misreporting is to reduce
the cognitive load of the respondent: we should only
ask relevant questions and reduce the un-needed ones.
We should also use simple terms and avoid unnecessary complex
or technical terms.
Giving enough background information avoids the necessity of guessing
what we mean, and this can reduce the variability of the answers.

Since the attention declines with time, it's generally better to
ask first important questions and keep the ones which require
less effort, such as the anagraphic ones, at the end.
