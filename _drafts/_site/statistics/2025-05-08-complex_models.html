<p>The aim of this post is a little bit different from all the previous
posts, and itâ€™s to illustrate how we can use PyMC to fit complex models.
To do so, we will use the Diebold-Li model, which is a model commonly
used in finance to fit the yield of bonds and other fixed income securities.
A bond is characterized by its duration, which usually goes from one
month to 30 years, and they are sold on a regular basis.
The US federal bank provides the daily values of all the US treasure bonds,
and our aim is to fit these curves.
The dataset can be obtained from
