<p>In the <a href="\gis\openeo">last post</a> we discussed how to use OpenEO
to access remote sensing data using the Sentinel 2 dataset.
In this post we will use the same library to access the Sentinel 1
dataset, which is a Synthetic Aperture Radar mission which collected
data from 2 satellites for many years.
SAR is quite different from visible data, and as the name suggests,
it is collected by a radar. This means that the light source
is on the satellite, so it can collect data regardless on the sun position.
Generally, SAR operates on frequencies much higher than the ones in the visible
spectrum, so they do not interact with clouds, and allows for a great
spatial resolution.
These characteristics make SAR imaging a very interesting tool
to monitor the Earth surface.</p>
