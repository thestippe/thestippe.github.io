<p>In the last post we briefly introduced the concept of random sampling.
In this post we will discuss this topic with a little bit more of details,
and see the advantages of probability sampling over non-probability sampling.
We will use the dataset provided in <a href="https://rpubs.com/hkoprivsek/1159747">this blog post</a>
and perform a similar analysis.</p>

<h2 id="simple-random-sampling">Simple random sampling</h2>
<p>Simple random sampling is, conceptually, the simplest kind of
sampling we can think.
In this sampling strategy, each element has the same probability of
being selected.
There are two kinds of simple random sampling, the <strong>simple random
sampling without replacement</strong> and the 
<strong>simple random
sampling with replacement</strong>.
In simple random sampling without replacement, each unit can only
be selected once, while if we allow for replacement
each unit can be selected an arbitrary number of times.
Simple random sampling without replacement is generally
preferred over simple random sampling with replacement, since it
allows for more precise estimates, simply because not allowing
for replacement ensures that our sampling includes a larger variety
of elements.</p>

<h2 id="cluster-sampling">Cluster sampling</h2>

<p>There are situations where, from a practical point of view, a simple random sampling
requires a large effort, and in this situation we may consider using
cluster sampling.
Imagine your population is given by the university students of your
Country, and your plan is to email them and ask to fill a questionnaire.</p>

<p>Simple random sampling would require to first collect the email addresses of
all the university students of your country, and then select a sample from
those emails.
This would be equivalent to perform a census, and this might demand a very
large effort.</p>

<p>A more reasonable strategy would be to randomly select a small number of 
universities, and ask them for the email addresses of their students.
In this case, we are clustering the students into groups, and the cluster
is the university of the student.
In general, cluster sampling gives less precise estimates with respect
to simple random sampling. The reason for this is that
units belonging to the same cluster tend to be more similar
than units belonging to different clusters.
When we perform cluster sampling, must therefore study a larger number of units in order to gain
the same information we would get by using simple random sampling.</p>

<h3 id="two-stage-and-multistage-sampling">Two stage and multistage sampling</h3>
<p>While in cluster sampling we sample all the units
from a given cluster, in two stage sampling we first perform a cluster sampling, and then
we select a given number of units from each sampling.
The main difference is that, in this way, we are not forced to consider
all the units of a cluster, but we can only consider a subgroup of them.</p>

<p>Two stage sampling can be straightforwardly generalized to multistage
sampling, when in each sampling stage we select a subgroup of units,
and only in the last stage we randomly select our units from the selected
subgroups.</p>

<p>As an example, we might cluster by geographical region, by university
and by faculty.</p>

<h2 id="stratified-sampling">Stratified sampling</h2>

<p>In stratified sampling we first divide our population into
groups named strata, and then we randomly select our units
from each stratum.
This allows us to choose the number of sampled units from each stratum
allowing us to make more precise estimates than we would do by using
simple random sampling.</p>

<h2 id="balanced-sampling">Balanced sampling</h2>

<p>Balanced sampling is a very powerful sampling method
developed by Deville and Till√© 20 years ago, and it allows us
to enforce constraints on the average values of any known quantity.
The main drawback of this sampling method is that it is computationally
demanding, and can only be used when the number of units in the population
is not too large.</p>
