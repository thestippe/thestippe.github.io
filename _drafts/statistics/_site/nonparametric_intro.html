<p>There are situations where a simple model is not appropriate for your purpose.
In these cases, you may decide and use a model with a number of parameters
which is not fixed a priori, but it is rather decided depending on the data.
In this section we will discuss this kind of model, and we will focus
on the following families:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gaussian Processes (GP)</li>
  <li>Dirichlet Processes (DP), in particular Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPM)</li>
  <li>Basis function expansions, in particular splines</li>
  <li>Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)</li>
</ul>

<p>These model are generally more flexible than the models discussed up
to now. They are also however more involved, and consequently harder
to understand. 
With respect to parametric models, non-parametric models are more likely to overfit,
so you should be careful when using them.</p>
