In the last example, we discussed how to perform a survival analysis
by providing a family for the survival function $S\,.$
This method provides strong constraints to the form of the survival function
and to the related quantities, but sometimes you might need 
more flexibility.
In this post we will see an alternative model, which gives you more flexibility.
While the previous method, however, treated the time as a continuous quantity,
the method discussed in this section makes the time discrete.
