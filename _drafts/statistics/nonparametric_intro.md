There are situations where a simple model is not appropriate for your purpose.
In these cases, you may decide and use a model with a number of parameters
which is not fixed a priori, but it is rather decided depending on the data.
In this section we will discuss this kind of model, and we will focus
on the following families:

- Dirichlet Processes (DP), in particular Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPM)
- Gaussian Processes (GP)
- Basis function expansions
- Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)
