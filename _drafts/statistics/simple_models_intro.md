In the following posts we will introduce some of the most popular distributions,
and we will apply them to simple problems in order to understand how to use them.
We will also introduce some basic aspects of PyMC and of its ecosystem (mostly Arviz).
I will assume you have some basic knowledge about probability and statistics,
but no prior knowledge about Bayesian inference is required.
