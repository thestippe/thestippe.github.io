description: "Where I will discuss more general topics"
---

In this section I will put personal opinions and references to statistics which
are not strictly related to Bayesian models.

I decided to add this section because statistics is a huge discipline,
and the more I study it, the more I found interesting topics, which deserve to
be discussed.
The reason to discuss them is rather selfish, and it's simply because
I think discussing is one of the best ways to clarify my own ideas and spotting
my own mistakes.
