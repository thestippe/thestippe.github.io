- [The PyMC website](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) contains an always up-to-date documentation of this library, together with a variety of example from beginner to advanced level.
- Whenever I can I read [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), as it contains a huge amount of food for the Bayesian brain.
- [PyMC-lab's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PyMCLabs) has many applications of PyMC from a variety of resources.
- The blog of [Juan Camilo Orduz](https://juanitorduz.github.io/) contains some useful Bayesian models together with many other posts about ML and mathematics.
- I found very useful [Antonio Linero's notes about probabil](https://bookdown.org/theodds/StatModelingNotes/) about probabilistic modelling.
