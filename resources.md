## Links
- Take a look at Enrico Bertini's page, he will give you tons of ideas and, most important, a solid background. You will find all his channels at [http://enrico.bertini.io/](http://enrico.bertini.io/).
- Moritz Stefaner is the author of some of my favourite visualizations, he is really able to let you understand the data within a data visualization. He's the only truth and beauty operator, and you'll find him at [https://truth-and-beauty.net/](https://truth-and-beauty.net/).
- Tamara Munzner is an amazing teacher, and if you want to build a good dashboard you should take a look at her dataviz lectures on YouTube. Her home page is [https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/).
- [Data Sketches](https://www.datasketch.es/) is a blog held by Shirley Wu and Nadieh Bremer. Their book is very instructive if you have some JavaScript background and you want to find some new ideas on how to draw beautiful visualizations.
- On [Perceptual Edge](https://www.perceptualedge.com/) you will find many suggestions by Stephen Few on how (not) to make a data visualization.

## Books
- Edward Tufte has been called the "Leonardo da Vinci" of the data by the New York Times. You will learn a lot by all his books. You will find the complete list [here](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)
- [Information Visualization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780123814647/information-visualization) by Colin Ware will allow you to understand the mechanisms behind the human vision. It's a must read!
- [Visualization Analysis and Design](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/) can be considered the updated version of Colin Ware's book for dashboard. I loved it.
- [White space is not your enemy](https://wtf.tw/ref/golombisky.pdf) is a very nice introductory textbook to design, it will give you some basic knowledge on how to visually convey your message.

<!--
- [The PyMC website](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) contains an always up-to-date documentation of this library, together with a variety of example from beginner to advanced level.
- Whenever I can I read [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), as it contains a huge amount of food for the Bayesian brain.
- [PyMC-lab's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PyMCLabs) has many applications of PyMC from a variety of resources.
- The blog of [Juan Camilo Orduz](https://juanitorduz.github.io/) contains some useful Bayesian models together with many other posts about ML and mathematics.
- I found very useful [Antonio Linero's notes](https://bookdown.org/theodds/StatModelingNotes/) about probabilistic modelling.
