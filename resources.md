- [The PyMC website](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) contains an always up-to-date documentation of this library, together with a variety of example from beginner to advanced level.
- Whenever I can I read [Andrew Gelman's blog](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/), as it contains a huge amount of food for the Bayesian brain.
