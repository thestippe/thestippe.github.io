<div class="emphbox">
How to handle geographic data.
</div>

<span style="font-family:Zapfino;font-size:280%;line-height:36%">G</span>eographic Information Systems (GIS)
is the discipline which handles geographic data.
When I first approached this discipline, few years ago, I had to learn myself how
to manipulate GIS data, and I couldn't find many resources to do this in Python.
Since that time, I decided to dive in the topic, and here I will share some basic knowledge
about it.

This section is still work in progress, and I will soon write in this section.
<br>
Have fun!
