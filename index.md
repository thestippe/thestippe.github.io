## A personal blog about data visualization

<div class="emphbox">
Welcome to my blog!


<!--
Here I will collect and discuss some ideas that allowed me to improve my data
analysis, from Bayesian statistics (of course by using PyMC) to dataviz.
-->
Here I will share some ideas about data visualization.

</div>
I started to plot data since many years, but only few months ago I really went into
data visualization (or dataviz, if you prefer).
I attended some Coursera course of prof. Enrico Bertini, who also has a very interesting
podcast named [Data Stories](https://datastori.es/) together with Moritz Stefaner (who is the author, among the other things,
of some of my favourite illustrations on Scientific American).
The course allows you design and decide what is the best data visualization by
starting from what is currently known about our brain's processes in visual perception.

Since I discovered this research field I started reading books talking about this field,
and I began with the ones written written by the data visualization pioneer [Edward Tufte](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte).

I would like to share some (hopefully intelligent) though about data visualization.
Moreover, as Tufte himself wrote in his book Beautiful Evidence, "as teachers know, a very good way to learn something is to teach it", so let's try.

I hope you will enjoy!
